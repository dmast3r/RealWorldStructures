# RealWorldStructures

Welcome to the RealWorldStructures repository!

This repository is dedicated to providing quality implementations of common data structures and algorithms that are often found in real-world applications and frequently discussed in system design interviews. The best part? We have solutions in **multiple languages** to cater to a diverse audience!

## Objective

Our main objective is to help software engineers understand and implement complex data structures and algorithms with ease. Whether you're preparing for a coding interview or developing a system that could benefit from a Bloom Filter, we've got you covered.

## What Can You Find Here?

You'll find implementations of various algorithms and data structures, each in separate folders. Each folder contains its own README file that explains the specific data structure or algorithm and how to use the provided implementation. Some of the structures and algorithms you might find include:

- Bloom Filters
- Quad Trees
- And many more!

## Contributing

We encourage contributions! If you have an implementation of a data structure or algorithm that you'd like to share, or if you have a more efficient solution to an existing one, feel free to create a pull request.

## License

All of the code in this repository is shared under the MIT license.

## Let's Connect

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue. Let's make learning algorithms and data structures easy for everyone!
